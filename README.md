# Smart Email Support for Telecom Organisations - Provide automated customer support for emails

Providing customer support in a timely manner is very important to enhance customer experience. Organisations receive communication, from their customers, through various channels like emails, phone calls, applications etc. Organisations need to understand the intent and content of each of the communication and ask customers for any additional information required to fulfil their requests. Manually processing each email request requires a lot of time to go through the emails, understand them and respond to them in a quick and appropriate manner. Additionally, manual processing is error prone. Delay in acting on customer requests could affect customer satisfaction levels. This code pattern addresses these issues. It will demonstrates Watson’s ability to automate email responses that are related to business processes. Customers will benefit from more timely responses and clear instructions for what information is needed in order to fulfill their requests.

In this code pattern we take use cases of a telecom domain customer support who need to action upon email requests they receive from customer. We will consider request scenarios for **enabling a service**, **disabling a service**, **changing plan** and **Adding family member to plan**.

As a customer support, one should
- Know intent of email.
- Know information available in these emails.
- Identify information that is missing.
- Auto-compose responses and send emails.

This code pattern provides an automatic and cognitive way of achieving the above requirements. It uses natural language processing of emails, understanding intents of emails, auto composing responses and providing a dashboard with high level summary of intents and emails. While the use case demonstrated here is for a telecom domain, it can be applied to any domain. It integrates with database, which acts as a CRM, to pull customer information to validate emails and requests. It uses Watson Knowledge Studio for custom domain natural language processing, Watson Natural Language Understanding(NLU) to deploy custom domain model and get entities from emails, Watson Natural Language Classifier(NLC) to get intent of email, IBM Cloudant database to store emails and customer data, Node-RED to integrate with emails, Watson services and IBM Cloudant database, Node runtime for user interface application.

After completing this pattern, you will learn how to:
- Build a custom model using Watson Knowledge Studio and deploy it on Watson Natural Language Understanding.
- Build a Node-RED flow that integrates email server, Watson services (NLU and NLC) and IBM Cloudant database.
- Deploy application, send sample customer emails and see the emails being auto processed using a simple user interface.

# Flow
![Architecture](images/Architecture.png)

1. Deploy custom model, built for telecom use cases using Watson Knowledge Studio, to Watson Natural Language Understanding.
2. Node-RED flow gets (polls) for customer emails and retrieves them.
3. Customers are validated by matching customer email id and customer data available in Cloudant database for customer records.
4. Information (entities like name, phone number) in emails are identified using Watson NLU.
5. Intent (or service request type) of email is identified using Watson NLC.
6. Email content, entities, intent are saved in Cloudant email database for each request.
7. Customer support user accesses nodejs application deployed on IBM cloud.
8. Application fetches emails, entities and intents from Cloudant email database.
9. Responses to email are auto populated (auto composed) and customer support user can just click the send button to send response to customer.

    - Double click on `NLClassifier` node. Update NLC credentials. Update classifier_id as noted in [this section](#4-create-nlc-service-instance). Click `Done`.
  - Email db cloudant node
    - Double click on `email db cloudant node`.
    - Click the edit button against the field `Server`.
    - Enter Cloudant database service instance's `Host`, `Username` and `Password` and click `Update`. Click `Done`.
- Deploy Node-RED flow and check if it is working fine.
  - Click on `Deploy` on the top right corner of the screen.
  - Send an email from your email id (which acts as customer email - ensure that this email details are updated in customer_data database) to customer support email id as updated in FromEmail node of Node-RED.
  - Ensure that the Node-RED flow is executed and that debug messages are printed. Check this [link](https://nodered.org/docs/user-guide/nodes#debug) to find more details on debug node.
  - Populate the email database, by sending few emails with requests for *Plan Change*, *Enable Service*, *Disable Service*, *Add Family Member to plan*. Suggest you to send few emails with different intents. Ensure that sender emails ids are available in customer_data database of Cloudant.


## 6. Setup SendGrid service
Sendgrid service is used to send emails from our application to customers.
- Create an instance of sendgrid [here](https://console.bluemix.net/catalog/services/sendgrid). Select free plan.
- Create sendgrid apikey using this [link](https://sendgrid.com/docs/ui/account-and-settings/api-keys/).
- Update sendgrid api key in <project_root>/manifest.yml file against the key *sendgrid_api_key*.
- In <project_root>/manifest.yml, from email id is provided. User is free to change this email id to any email id they wish to, provided they have password for it.

## 7. Deploy application and send emails
- Go to the cloned project parent folder. In command prompt, change directory to cloned project parent folder using command `cd smart-email-support`.
- Open manifest.yml in any text editor.
- Under **services** update the Cloudant service instance name.
- On command prompt, login to IBM Cloud using `ibmcloud login` or `ibmcloud login --sso` (for federated login).
- Run the below command to deploy the application to IBM Cloud.
```
ibmcloud cf push
```
- Check the logs of the application using the command `ibmcloud cf logs <app_name> --recent`.
- Ensure that the application is deployed to IBM Cloud successfully. If you see any errors in logs, fix them and redeploy the application.


## 8. Run the application
- Login to IBM Cloud and go to dashboard. There you will see that the application is deployed and running.
- Click on the application and click on `Visit App URL`.
- The application home page opens.

![AppHomePage](images/AppHomePage.png)

- The home page shows a dashboard containing intents of emails, and for each intent it shows number of emails, completed emails and emails that need attention.
- If there are no emails, then the home page shows a blank page. Send few emails, as instructed in [this section](#52-deploy-node-red-flow), with different intents so that there is some data to get populated in the application.
- Click on emails link, shown in below image, to see list of emails

![EmailsLink](images/EmailsLink.png)

- Below image shows the table of emails. It shows *timestamp*, *subject*, *status* and *text*

![ListOfEmails](images/ListOfEmails.png)

- Click on any row to get more details

![EmailDetails](images/EmailDetails.png)

Here you can see what all entities were identified and what all entities are missing

- Responses to emails are auto composed. User can just click the send button to send response to customer. Ensure that the email is received on customer email id.

> Editing auto composed email is not provided in this code pattern while the user can use this code pattern to implement this feature

![SendEmail](images/SendEmail.png)

That concludes the flow of the application.


# Summary
We saw that emails sent by customers are categorised into different intents. Emails are parsed to identify information available in emails. Missing information, if any, is identified. Email responses are auto composed and customer support representative can just click a button to send the auto composed email. We used WKS to build a custom model and deployed it on NLU to extract entities from emails. We used NLC to get intents of emails, sendgrid to send email and Note-RED flow for process orchestration. We used a Node application to show the working of this use case.
